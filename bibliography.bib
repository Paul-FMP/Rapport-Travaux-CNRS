Here we extend coarse-graining to open Markov processes. An “open” Markov process is one where probability can flow in or out of certain states called “inputs” and “outputs”. One can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov process with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov processes side by side. In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author showed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category. Here we go further by constructing a symmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms are ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes. We also extend the already known “black-boxing” functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double category. Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation between input and output data that holds in steady states, including nonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability through the process. To extend black-boxing to a functor between double categories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with coarse-graining.}, note={arXiv:1710.11343 [math-ph]}, number={arXiv:1710.11343}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Baez, John C. and Courser, Kenny}, year={2018}, month=nov }

Therefore, the research production on “Explainable AI” (xAI) should raise considerable scientific controversy and social debate.

In contrast, this communication emphasizes the actual almost non-existence of controversy emerging from the development of the xAI literature. Even though, in 2016, DARPA’s “Explainable AI program” was followed by a sudden appearance of scientific publications on xAI, those generally framed xAI as a technical problem rather than an epistemological and political one.

Exploring this paradox between an abundant literature on xAI and an absence of controversy, we intend to open the black box of self-appointed AI-explainers. Our presentation thus urges a renewal of STS methodologies to establish a critical typology of xAI techniques. Our methodology was twofold: we first systematically categorized 12,000+ papers in the xAI research field, then proceeded to an analysis of the mathematical content of a representatively diversified sample. As a first result, we show that xAI methods come considerably diversified. We summarize this diversity in a 3-dimensional typology: technical dimension (what kind of calculation is used?), empirical dimension (what is being looked at?) and ontological dimension (what makes the explanation right?) standpoints.

The heterogeneity of those techniques not only illustrates disciplinary specificities, but also shows that the research field on xAI progresses rather autonomously and opportunistically with primary objectives to fuel market strategies and answer the institutional demand for explanation}, booktitle={Making and doing transformations}, publisher={European Association for the Study of Science and Technology and Society for Social Studies of Science}, author={Berkouk, Nicolas and Pialat, Romain and Arfaoui, Mehdi and Francois, Pierre and Barry, Laurence}, year={2024}, month=july }

We introduce double port graphs, a bidirectional generalization of port graphs, to represent the quantum (horizontal) and classical (vertical) flows of information within computational architectures. Quantum operations are described as adaptive instruments, organized into a one-object double category whose horizontal and vertical directions correspond to quantum channels and stochastic maps, respectively. Within this setting, we capture prominent adaptive quantum computation models, including measurement-based and magic-state models. To analyze computational power, we extend the theory of contextuality to an adaptive setting through the notion of simplicial instruments, which generalize simplicial distributions to double categorical form. This construction yields a quantitative characterization of computational power in terms of contextual fraction, leading to a categorical formulation of the result that non-contextual resources can compute only affine Boolean functions. The framework thus offers a new perspective on the interplay between adaptivity, contextuality, and computational power in quantum computational models.}, note={arXiv:2510.25915 [quant-ph]}, number={arXiv:2510.25915}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Okay, Cihan and Stern, Walker and Haderi, Redi and Ipek, Selman}, year={2025}, month=oct }

The idea and mathematics of closed dynamical systems has proven incredibly useful in those sciences that can isolate their object of study from its environment. But many changing situations in the world cannot be meaningfully isolated from their environment - a cell will die if it is removed from everything beyond its walls. To study systems that interact with their environment, and to design such systems in a modular way, we need a robust theory of open dynamical systems. In this extended abstract, we put forward a general definition of open dynamical system. We define two general sorts of morphisms between these systems: covariant morphisms which include trajectories, steady states, and periodic orbits; and contravariant morphisms which allow for plugging variables of some systems into parameters of other systems. We define an indexed double category of open dynamical systems indexed by their interface and use a double Grothendieck construction to construct a double category of open dynamical systems. In our main theorem, we construct covariantly representable indexed double functors from the indexed double category of dynamical systems to an indexed double category of spans. This shows that all covariantly representable structures of dynamical systems - including trajectories, steady states, and periodic orbits - compose according to the laws of matrix arithmetic.}, note={arXiv:2005.05956 [math]}, journal={Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science}, author={Myers, David Jaz}, year={2021}, month=feb, pages={154–167} }

This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology. We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK.

On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade.

This is in contrast with the more traditional circuit model that is based on unitary operations. Among measurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way quantum computer [Raussendorf and Briegel 2001] stands out as fundamental.We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum computer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs, which we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning locally and compositionally about these patterns. We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form. Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models, for example, Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory we develop for the one-way model to these models.

More specifically, it focuses on representations and applications of string diagrams. String diagrams are used to represent a collection of processes, depicted as “boxes” with multiple (typed) inputs and outputs, depicted as “wires”. If we allow plugging input and output wires together, we can intuitively represent complex compositions of processes, formalised as morphisms in a monoidal category. [...] The first major contribution of this dissertation is the introduction of a discretised version of a string diagram called a string graph. String graphs form a partial adhesive category, so they can be manipulated using double-pushout graph rewriting. Furthermore, we show how string graphs modulo a rewrite system can be used to construct free symmetric traced and compact closed categories on a monoidal signature. The second contribution is in the application of graphical languages to quantum information theory. We use a mixture of diagrammatic and algebraic techniques to prove a new classification result for strongly complementary observables. [...] We also introduce a graphical language for multipartite entanglement and illustrate a simple graphical axiom that distinguishes the two maximally-entangled tripartite qubit states: GHZ and W. [...] The third contribution is a description of two software tools developed in part by the author to implement much of the theoretical content described here. The first tool is Quantomatic, a desktop application for building string graphs and graphical theories, as well as performing automated graph rewriting visually.

Later final coalgebras were used in order to deal with infinite data types. Coalgebras, which are the dual of algebras, turned out to be suited, moreover, as models for certain types of automata and more generally, for (transition and dynamical) systems. An important property of initial algebras is that they satisfy the familiar principle of induction. Such a principle was missing for coalgebras until the work of Aczel (Non-Well-Founded sets, CSLI Leethre Notes, Vol. 14, center for the study of Languages and information, Stanford, 1988) on a theory of non-wellfounded sets, in which he introduced a proof principle nowadays called coinduction. It was formulated in terms of bisimulation, a notion originally stemming from the world of concurrent programming languages. Using the notion of coalgebra homomorphism, the definition of bisimulation on coalgebras can be shown to be formally dual to that of congruence on algebras. Thus, the three basic notions of universal algebra: algebra, homomorphism of algebras, and congruence, turn out to correspond to coalgebra, homomorphism of coalgebras, and bisimulation, respectively. In this paper, the latter are taken as the basic ingredients of a theory called universal coalgebra. Some standard results from universal algebra are reformulated (using the aforementioned correspondence) and proved for a large class of coalgebras, leading to a series of results on, e.g., the lattices of subcoalgebras and bisimulations, simple coalgebras and coinduction, and a covariety theorem for coalgebras similar to Birkhoff’s variety theorem.}, number={1}, journal={Theoretical Computer Science}, author={Rutten, J.

It has applications in robust statistics and machine learning.        We look at programming language models for imprecise probability. Our desiderata are that we would like our model to support all kinds of composition, categorical and monoidal; in other words, guided by dataflow diagrams. Another equivalent perspective is that we would like a model of synthetic probability in the sense of Markov categories.        Imprecise probability can be modelled in various ways, with the leading monad-based approach using convex sets of probability distributions. This model is not fully compositional because the monad involved is not commutative, meaning it does not have a proper monoidal structure. In this work, we provide a new fully compositional account. The key idea is to name the non-deterministic choices. To manage the renamings and disjointness of names, we use graded monads. We show that the resulting compositional model is maximal and relate it with the earlier monadic approach, proving that we obtain tighter bounds on the uncertainty.}, number={POPL}, journal={Proc.

	abstract = {We show that streams and lazy data structures are a natural idiom for programming with infinite-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Poisson processes, Gaussian processes, jump processes, Dirichlet processes, and Beta processes. The crucial semantic idea, inspired by developments in synthetic probability theory, is to work with two separate monads: an affine monad of probability, which supports laziness, and a commutative, non-affine monad of measures, which does not. (Affine means that T(1)≅ 1.) We show that the separation is important from a decidability perspective, and that the recent model of quasi-Borel spaces supports these two monads. To perform Bayesian inference with these examples, we introduce new inference methods that are specially adapted to laziness; they are proven correct by reference to the Metropolis-Hastings-Green method. Our theoretical development is implemented as a Haskell library, LazyPPL.},

To explain what exactly an infinity-category is requires various technical models, raising the question of how they might be compared. To overcome this, a model-independent approach is desired, so that theorems proven with any model would apply to them all. This text develops the theory of infinity-categories from first principles in a model-independent fashion using the axiomatic framework of an infinity-cosmos, the universe in which infinity-categories live as objects. An infinity-cosmos is a fertile setting for the formal category theory of infinity-categories, and in this way the foundational proofs in infinity-category theory closely resemble the classical foundations of ordinary category theory. Equipped with exercises and appendices with background material, this first introduction is meant for students and researchers who have a strong foundation in classical 1-category theory.}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Riehl, Emily and Verity, Dominic}, year={2022}, collection={Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics} }

This means that we treat the following concepts in purely abstract categorical terms: conditioning and disintegration; various versions of conditional independence and its standard properties; conditional products; almost surely; sufficient statistics; versions of theorems on sufficient statistics due to Fisher–Neyman, Basu, and Bahadur. Besides the conceptual clarity offered by our categorical setup, its main advantage is that it provides a uniform treatment of various types of probability theory, including discrete probability theory, measure-theoretic probability with general measurable spaces, Gaussian probability, stochastic processes of either of these kinds, and many others.}
